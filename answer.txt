[Algorithms]

The word Algorithm means “a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations”. Therefore Algorithm refers to a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step define how a work is to be executed upon in order to get the expected results. 
algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.
The Algorithm designed are language-independent, i.e. they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.

Characteristics of an Algorithm

In order for some instructions to be an algorithm, it must have the following characteristics:


    *Clear and Unambiguous: Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must lead to only one meaning.
    *Well-Defined Inputs: If an algorithm says to take inputs, it should be well-defined inputs.
    *Well-Defined Outputs: The algorithm must clearly define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as well.
    *Finite-ness: The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it should not end up in an infinite loops or similar.
    *Feasible: The algorithm must be simple, generic and practical, such that it can be executed upon will the available resources. It must not contain some future technology, or anything.
    *Language Independent: The Algorithm designed must be language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be same, as expected.

Advantages of Algorithms:

    *It is easy to understand.
    *Algorithm is a step-wise representation of a solution to a given problem.
    *In Algorithm the problem is broken down into smaller pieces or steps hence, it is easier for the programmer to convert it into an actual program.

Disadvantages of Algorithms:

    *Writing an algorithm takes a long time so it is time-consuming.
    *Branching and Looping statements are difficult to show in Algorithms.

Example of Algorithm:

    Algorithm : Finding Root of the quadratic equatin ax2 + bx + c = 0

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables a, b, c, D, x1, x2, rp and ip;
Step 3: Calculate discriminant
         D ← b2-4ac
Step 4: If D ≥ 0
              r1 ← (-b+√D)/2a
              r2 ← (-b-√D)/2a 
              Display r1 and r2 as roots.
        Else     
              Calculate real part and imaginary part
              rp ← -b/2a
              ip ← √(-D)/2a
              Display rp+j(ip) and rp-j(ip) as roots
Step 5: Stop             



[Flowchart]

Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. 
The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”. 

Basic Symbols used in Flowchart Designs
    <pic name Terminal.jpg>
    *Terminal: The oval symbol indicates Start, Stop and Halt in a program’s logic flow. A pause/halt is generally used in a program logic under some error conditions. Terminal is the first and last symbols in the flowchart. 
    <pic name input output.jpg>
    *Input/Output: A parallelogram denotes any function of input/output type. Program instructions that take input from input devices and display output on output devices are indicated with parallelogram in a flowchart. 
    <pic name processing.jpg>
    *Processing: A box represents arithmetic instructions. All arithmetic processes such as adding, subtracting, multiplication and division are indicated by action or process symbol. 
    <pic name decision.jpg>
    *decision:Diamond symbol represents a decision point. Decision based operations such as yes/no question or true/false are indicated by diamond in flowchart. 
    <pic name connectors.jpg>
    *Connectors: Whenever flowchart becomes complex or it spreads over more than one page, it is useful to use connectors to avoid any confusions. It is represented by a circle.

    *Flow lines: Flow lines indicate the exact sequence in which instructions are executed. Arrows represent the direction of flow of control and relationship among different symbols of flowchart. 

Advantages of Flowchart:

    *Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of system.
    *Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.
    *Flowcharts helps in debugging process.
    *With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.
    *It provides better documentation.
    *Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.

Disadvantages of Flowchart:

    *It is difficult to draw flowchart for large and complex programs.
    *In this their is no standard to determine the amount of detail.
    *Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.
    *It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.
